# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using JavaScript, HTML, and APIs to map Earthquake data

Please see the ![Earthquake_Challenge](https://github.com/JonathanBrown003/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge) folder to view the HTML, JavaScript, and css files. 

## Summary
The purpose of this analysis was to map earthquake data using API's and JavaScript to overlay 3 tile layers on the map - Streets, Satellite, and Dark. 

We then plotted tectonic plate lines on the map that can be toggled on and off as well as major earthquake magnitudes above 4.5. The earthquakes will have a different color displayed in the circle on the map according to their magnitude. Please see the legend in the bottom right corner of the map to view the color coding.
